# SpotifyGenerator
This project is based off of this data set from Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks">Spotify Dataset</a>

After cleaning the data, I used sklearn's knn model to predict songs closest to any one user selected song based off of the numeric data columns
